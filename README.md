GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### 2.Monthly Order Volume

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS monthly_order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### Top 3 Months by Revenue

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Revenue by Product
```sql
